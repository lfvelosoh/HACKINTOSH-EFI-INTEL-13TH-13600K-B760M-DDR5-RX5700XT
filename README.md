## Kexts used (included)
Kext|Description
:----|:----
[Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)|Patch many processes, required for AppleALC, WhateverGreen, VirtualSMC and many other kexts.
[SMCProcessor.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases)|Used for monitoring CPU temperature, doesn't work on AMD CPU based systems.
[SMCSuperIO.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases)|Used for monitoring fan speed, doesn't work on AMD CPU based systems.
[VirtualSMC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases)|Emulates the SMC chip found on real macs, without this macOS will not boot.<br>Alternative is FakeSMC which can have better or worse support, most commonly used on legacy hardware.
[WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)|Used for graphics patching, DRM fixes, board ID checks, framebuffer fixes, etc; all GPUs benefit from this kext.
[AppleALC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/releases)|Used for AppleHDA patching, allowing support for the majority of on-board sound controllers.<br>AMD 15h/16h may have issues with this and Ryzen/Threadripper systems rarely have mic support.
[LucyRTL8125Ethernet.kext](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/1004-lucyrtl8125ethernet/)|For Realtek's 2.5Gb Ethernet.
[NVMeFix](https://github.com/acidanthera/NVMeFix/releases)|Used for fixing power management and initialization on non-Apple NVMe.
[RestrictEvents](https://github.com/acidanthera/RestrictEvents/releases)|Better experience with unsupported processors like AMD, Disable MacPro7,1 memory warnings and provide upgrade to macOS Monterey via Software Updates when available.
[CpuTscSync](https://github.com/acidanthera/CpuTscSync/releases)|It is a Lilu plugin, combining functionality of VoodooTSCSync and disabling xcpm_urgency if TSC is not in sync. It should solve some kernel panics after wake.
[USBWakeFixup](https://github.com/osy/USBWakeFixup)|This extension is a workaround for that issue by creating a fake ACPI device with the right wakeup params.
